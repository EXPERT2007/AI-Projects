## **🛠️ How to Run**

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EXPERT2007/AI-Projects.git
cd AI-Projects
```

Then dive into any project folder and run the code.  
Each project has its own scripts and (sometimes) its own setup instructions.

Example:

```bash
cd Supervised-Learning/House\ Price\ Prediction
python train_model.py
```

*Make sure you have Python installed and the needed libraries (check each project for requirements).*
