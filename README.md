## **ðŸŽ® Snake AI**
A reinforcement learning project where an AI agent learns to play the classic Snake game. The agent uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn optimal strategies for maximizing score.

### **Features**
- Custom Snake game environment built with Pygame
- Deep Q-Learning implementation for training the agent
- Visual representation of the Snake game and AI performance
- Model saves progress during training

### **Technologies Used**
- Python
- PyTorch
- Pygame
- NumPy

## **ðŸŽ² Connect4 AI**
An AI implementation that plays the classic Connect 4 game. This project implements game mechanics and AI decision-making algorithms to create a challenging opponent.

### **Features**
- Complete Connect 4 game implementation
- AI opponent using intelligent game strategies
- Interactive gameplay interface

### **Technologies Used**
- Python
